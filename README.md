About:
------
 - Encryp.us is an open-source web chat application built with privacy as a priority. *
 - Encryp.us uses several different encryption techniques ensuring that your communication cannot be read.
 - For group chats all messages are encrypted with AES with a session stored password only known to your browser, and never known by the server or those spying on your connection.
 - For one to one chat, all messages are encrypted using an AES cipher. There is also no need for a key to be exchanged via unsecure lines of communication. A key is automatically generated based on the Diffie-Hellman exchange.
 - All passwords are salted and hashed on the server.
 - Encryp.us protects users by using SSL / TLS, ensuring encrypted communication between server and client.
 - Clone the project and upload to your own server as you wish!

Planned Enhancements:
----------
 - add better encryption - multi-layer
 - add encryption to everything i.e. username, password, timestamp
 - add expiration to messages -- TTL
 - personal question to ask user upon entering for the first time --
   validated
 - change routing of urls
 - add otr with user to user chat
 - emoji
 - notifications, sounds, favicon.js
